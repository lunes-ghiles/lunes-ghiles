- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lunes-ghiles
- I'm a UTSC Double Degree student and I'm mostly interested in coding projects related to finance and economics, with some projects more related to mathematics and statistics. Most recently, I'm trying to figure out how to take course material learnt in courses such as Linear Algebra, Introduction to Financial Derivatives, Introduction to Finance and Statistics.
